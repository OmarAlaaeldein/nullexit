# Docker Gateway: Tailscale + Cloudflare WARP

This guide details how to set up a chained network gateway that routes all Tailscale exit-node traffic through a Cloudflare WARP VPN tunnel.

## 1. Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- A Tailscale account.
- `wgcf` tool to generate a WARP WireGuard profile.

## 2. Generate WARP WireGuard Profile
Use [`wgcf`](https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf) to generate a Cloudflare WARP WireGuard profile.

1. Register a new identity:
   ```bash
   wgcf register
   ```
   Accept the Terms of Service. This will create a `wgcf-account.toml` file.

2. Generate the WireGuard profile:
   ```bash
   wgcf generate
   ```
   This will create a `wgcf-profile.conf` file.

3. Map the keys from `wgcf-profile.conf` to a `.env` file for your Docker setup. 
   Create a `.env` file in this directory and populate it:

   ```env
   # Extract these values from your generated wgcf-profile.conf
   WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY=<PrivateKey from the [Interface] section>
   WIREGUARD_PUBLIC_KEY=<PublicKey from the [Peer] section>
   WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES=<Address from the [Interface] section (e.g., 172.16.0.2/32)>
   
   # Get this from your Tailscale Admin Console (Settings > Keys > Generate auth key)
   TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-...
   ```

## 3. Deploy the Gateway

Run the following command to start the gateway in the background:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
*Note: Make sure your `.env` file is in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file.*

## 4. Post-Deployment Instructions

### Approve the Exit Node
1. Go to the [Tailscale Admin Console - Machines](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines).
2. Locate the new `tailscale` device in your machine list.
3. Click the `...` menu next to the machine and select **Edit route settings...**.
4. Under the "Exit nodes" section, toggle the switch to approve this machine as an exit node.

### Verify the Traffic Flow
1. On your mobile device (or any other Tailscale client), open the Tailscale app.
2. Ensure Tailscale is connected.
3. Tap on "Exit Node" and select the newly deployed gateway node.
4. Visit a site like [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) or [whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/).
5. Your IP should now reflect a Cloudflare IP instead of your local ISP, confirming the tunnel-in-tunnel (Tailscale -> WARP) traffic flow is working successfully.
